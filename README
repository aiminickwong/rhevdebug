-Updated to toggle debug output
-Formatted output of the SPM/UUID data
-Changed regex looking for the SPM UUIDs so we don't have to guess which column contains the information
-Disabled the "database" functionality (it was never there) so that I could use the '-d' flag to toggle debug messages

The way this program operates is an evolving process. As of now, you either specify a thread ID (with the engine log and vdsm log) to pull the relevant information from the logs, or you can point the program to the root of the LC (WIP).

The end goal of this project is to make reading and parsing a log collector much quicker and efficient. By yanking out all members of a thread, with the relevant VDSM errors in that time frame, a user would not have to spend as much time parsing logs manually. Maybe this could lead to automatically loading the database on a dbviewer, maybe this will evolve to a python project which can utilize the REST API.. there's much work the be done.
