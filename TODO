Current Capabilities:
- Yank threads from engine.log files (including compressed), organize them, report errors from them, and then correlate to vdsm logs if provided

To Do / Idea List:
- If tool can not locate dbdump from root dir, search for the 'log-collector-date' dir and extrat all files inside
